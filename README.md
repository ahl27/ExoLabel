## ExoLabel Source Code

This repository contains source code for ExoLabel, a network community detection algorithm that can scale to large graphs with limited resources by keeping data on disk whenever possible.

This code is released as both a C distribution and an R distribution. The `Submodule` branch is intended to be used as a submodule imported into other projects. The R binding is available in the [SynExtend](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SynExtend.html) package for R. A C version will be implemented on the `release` branch.

Instructions for using this in your own projects are forthcoming.
